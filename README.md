# Essential-Java-Template

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RyanFleck/Essential-Java-Template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RyanFleck/Essential-Java-Template)

This repository is a companion to the article [Programming: 0 to 90 in Java](https://ryanfleck.github.io) which will be up on my personal site soon. It details how to get started from scratch, and walks the reader through installing Java and an IDE, the structure of a simple program, how to write and run a small program, the use of Java in an enterprise setting, what people will pay you to write, and how to build something that people can trust using CI and Unit Tests.
